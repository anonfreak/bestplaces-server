# BestPlaces
Track your favorite Places and find more of them.
## Structure
Because of our Server-Client-Structure, we decided to use two different repositories to devide server and client, which both are written in different languages. You are able to access our client-repository [here](http://github.com/anonfreak/bestplaces-client).
## Idea
Our server will be able to communicate with clients by using a RESTful API, developed with Python. Therefore, we use Django to provide our own API.
